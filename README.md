# angularMATHBOARD 
UIT SaaS app project by Freddie Willett, 02-12-16

angularMATHBOARD is a re-creation of my chat app in Angular. Unfortunately, I couldn't recreate the canvas aspect of the 
original Mathboard to be unique in private chats. It worked in the original because it was only one room for everyone. 

How do I host my own Mathboard with a private database?

1. Clone repo

2. Switch my Firebase keys for yours in index.html

3. Open up your terminal, and change directory to where you downloaded the repo using the cd command

4. Run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"

5. Open localhost:8000 in your browser of choice

6. You should now be running your own local Mathboard site with your own database for chat, profiles and rooms!
